# What is this program?

This is a simple program written and based off the black hat go module for image injection accept turned into more options and a bit more improoved / tidied up for a information based module, EXIF hunter can do all of the following 

<br>


> Inject PNG images 

> Grab EXIF data from all image formats 

> Grab Offset's, chunks, crc, chunk types, etc from PNG images

> encode injection payloads for PNG image formats 

> decode injected data and payloads for PNG image formats

> hex dump files and images 

> specify chunks to inject PNG images with 

> Inject ZIP files into JPG/JPEG image formats

> Extract hidden ZIP files inside of JPG/JPEG image formats

> Grab and map the GEO location of a JPG/JPEG image 

> Walk Filepaths for all files matching image names ( jpg, jpeg, png, gif etc )

> Discover unknown file types

> Scrape and dump all EXIF data of every image or file inside of a directory that matches titles of JPG, PNG, JPEG etc 

and some more if you dig into it and get used to the program itself
